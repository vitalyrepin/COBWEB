      *> Writing HTML5/CSS3 RESPONSIVE Web pages 
      *> using OpenCOBOL.  A little fun XMAS task 
      *> I set for myself as I am getting tired of
      *> spotty num-nums telling me that to write
      *> Web 2.0 pages you NEED Ruby on Rails, Haskell,
      *> F#, Scala and or some unhealthy mixture of
      *> the lot of the rubbish.  Don't get me wrong,
      *> I am no great lover of COBOL.  Of course I can use it. 
      *> This just shows that a well structured bit of
      *> code can perform ANY task if asked nicely.
      *>
      *> My preference is to use HTML5, CSS3 and PHP and
      *> Modern Perl for the structured code portion of
      *> an application that uses Web 2.0 technology, but
      *> OLD COBOL does just as well! RoR, Elang, F#,
      *> Scala ALL look like BIG FAT UGLY COMPLEX systems
      *> that use the most complicated method of doing something
      *> simple.  I don't know whether anyone will use this
      *> code, but it may be of interest to a data shop
      *> already running a squillion lines of COBOL and a big
      *> chunk-O-COBOL WARRIORS!  The other consideration is
      *> that your web application is compiled code.  No script
      *> kiddies getting into your PHP and filling it full
      *> of Malware and Porn...
      *>
      *> Hmmm, on that note, I decided to take the CSS3 out of the
      *> CSS file/directory and embed the CSS in here.  That REALLY
      *> will stop hackers from a lot of the backdoor 'background'
      *> and iframe attacks.
      *>
      *> I also decided to write a JSON parser for COBOL today.
      *> I spent an hour with GOOBLE and nada.
      *>
      *> I decided to implement the JSON parser as a copybook in a
      *> seperate master tree.  It is really two different projects.
      *> For now I'll implent a quick and dirty config reader.
      *>
      *> A word from W3C
      *>
      *> Congratulations!
      *>
      *> The uploaded document "web2.html" was successfully checked as
      *> HTML5. This means that the resource in question identified
      *> itself as "HTML5" and that we successfully performed a formal
      *> validation of it. The parser implementations we used for this
      *> check are based on validator.nu (HTML5).
      *>
      *> Not bad for a language that was born in the same year
      *> as I. 1959.  There are still 40 BILLION lines of
      *> operational COBOL code running in the world TODAY!
